It was Lorenzo's job, as head of quality control, to test every cork board for its ability to hold thumbtacks.  He placed one thumbtack from each of the three cans of thumbtacks into every board tested.  At the end of the day, he had tested 120 boards and had 30 tacks remaining in each of the three cans.  What was the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans?",
