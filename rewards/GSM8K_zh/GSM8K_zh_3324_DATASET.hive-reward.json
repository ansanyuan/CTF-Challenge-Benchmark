For the first three miles, Brad steered as Jim and Marcus pushed at a speed of 6 miles per hour.  Then, for the next 3 miles, Jim steered, as Brad and Marcus pushed at a speed of 3 miles per hour.  For the last four miles, Marcus steered as Brad and Jim pushed at a speed of 8 miles per hour.  How long did it take, in hours, to push the car back to town?",
