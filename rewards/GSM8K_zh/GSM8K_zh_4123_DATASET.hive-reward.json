She wants to find out how many of each plant she has pictures of, but she has 960 pictures, and counting them all will take her a long time. Her teacher suggested she use a program on the computer that can automatically tell her what plant is in each picture and count them for her. It will take the program 2 minutes to process each picture. How many hours will it take to process all of the pictures?",
