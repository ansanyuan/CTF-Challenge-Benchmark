She then has to dip the cookies in white icing and allow the icing to harden for 30 minutes. Then she has to re-dip them in chocolate icing and allowed to harden for an additional 30 minutes.  If it takes her 2 hours to make the cookies from start to finish, how long does it take to make the dough and cool the cookies before she can start dipping them?",
