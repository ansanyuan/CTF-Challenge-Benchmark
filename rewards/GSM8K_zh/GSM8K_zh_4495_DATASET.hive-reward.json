  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Thomas started saving for a car almost 2 years ago. For the first year, his weekly allowance was $50. In the second year, he got a job that pays $9 an hour at a coffee shop and worked 30 hours a week, so his parents discontinued his allowance. If the car he wants to buy is $15,000 and he spends $35 a week on himself, how much more money does Thomas need to buy the car by the end of the 2 years?",
