Her little cousin Andy ate 3 slices from the bread at two different points in time, and then Emma decided she would make toast with the remaining slices. If she uses 2 slices of bread to make 1 piece of toast bread, how many slices were in the original loaf if she was able to make 10 pieces of toast bread and had 1 slice of bread left?",
