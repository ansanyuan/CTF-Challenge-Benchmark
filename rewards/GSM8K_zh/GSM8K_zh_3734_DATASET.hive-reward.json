  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Last year, Jorge planted corn on all of his 60 acres of property.  Typically, corn grown on good soil yields 400 bushels per acre, but in clay-rich soil, the yield is only half as much per acre as in good soil.  One-third of Jorge's 60 acres of land is clay-rich soil and the rest is good soil.  How many bushels of corn did Jorge's land yield last year?",
