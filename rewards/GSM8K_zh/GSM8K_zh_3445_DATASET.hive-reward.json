The list included a carton of milk for $4.00, a loaf of bread for $3.50, a box of laundry detergent for $10.25 and 2 pounds of bananas that were $0.75 per pound.  Her mom also gave her a coupon for $1.25 off of the laundry detergent.  At checkout, the clerk told her the milk was 1/2 off today.  How much money did Josie have left over after she bought all of the groceries?",
