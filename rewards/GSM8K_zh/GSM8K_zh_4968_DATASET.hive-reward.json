  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：A company has a tank that is already filled at a maximum capacity of 350,000 gallons of water. One day the tank starts losing 32,000 gallons/hour for 5 hours, after that time the company repaired the tank but it wasn't enough because the tank was still losing 10,000 gallons/hour. It stayed like that for 10 hours. In the second attempt, they managed to repair the tank and started filling it with 40,000 gallons/hour. After 3 hours, how many gallons are missing for the tank to be at maximum capacity again?",
