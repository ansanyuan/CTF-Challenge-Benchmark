The government will pay for part of this cost depending on Bill's income: 90% if he makes less than $10,000, 50% if he makes between $10,001 and $40,000, and 20% if he makes more than $50,000. Bill earns $25/hour and works 30 hours per week, four weeks per month. How much will Bill spend for health insurance in a year?",
