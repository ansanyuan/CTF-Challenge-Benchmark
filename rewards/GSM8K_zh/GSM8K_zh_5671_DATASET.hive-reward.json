  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Miss Smith is teaching second period English and is shocked at how small the class seems. There are 6 tables in the classroom with 3 students currently sitting at each table. Sally said 3 girls went to the bathroom, and three times more students went to the canteen. Elliott said that 2 groups of students have recently been added to their class, and each group has 4 students in it. None of these students are in the class right now. Lucas pointed out that a few foreign exchange students have joined the class; 3 from Germany, 3 from France, and 3 from Norway. These students are also missing. How many students are supposed to be in the class?",
