  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Henry needs to declutter his book collection of 99 books.  From his bookshelf, he was able to fill 3 boxes of 15 books each to take to a donation center.  He had 21 books in a room he could donate, 4 on his coffee table and 18 cookbooks stashed in the kitchen.  When he dropped them off, he noticed a box of books that had a  \"free to a good home\" note.  He grabbed 12 books to take back to his place.  How many books does Henry now have?",
