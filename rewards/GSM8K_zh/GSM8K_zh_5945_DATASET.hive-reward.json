  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：A farmer is checking his fields to make sure all of his crops are growing as they should. Rows of corn stalks should produce 9 corn cobs each, and rows of potatoes should produce 30 potatoes each. As he’s checking crop quality, he notices that there are more pests than usual and they have destroyed some of his crops. He thinks that half of his crops have been destroyed by the pests. If the farmer has 10 rows of corn stalks and 5 rows of potatoes, how many crops does the farmer still have?",
