At first, he was driving at 80 miles/hour for about 6 hours, then the speed limit changed and he had to slow down to 60 miles/hour, and so he drove at this speed for 4 hours. Then he made a stop at a gas station. Once the car was full of gas, he drove at 40 miles/hour the rest of the trip for 2 hours. How many miles did he travel?",
