  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Mary has a mystery book library. She started with 72 mystery books at the beginning of the year. She joined a book club that sent her 1 book each month of the year. She went to a bookstore halfway through the year and bought 5 more books, then bought 2 books at yard sales later. Her daughter gave her another book for her birthday, and her mother gave her a series of 4 books when Mary visited her. She donated 12 books she didn't want to read again to a charity shop and sold 3 to a used book store. How many books did she have at the end of the year?",
