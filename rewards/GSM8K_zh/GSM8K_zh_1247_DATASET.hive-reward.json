  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：A spaceship is traveling to another planet. The spaceship travels at a consistent speed its entire journey unless it is stopped for the crew’s break. After launch, the spaceship traveled for 10 hours then stopped for 3 hours. It then traveled for another 10 hours then stopped for 1 hour. After this, the spaceship would take an hour’s break after every 11 hours of traveling and maintained this routine until the end of its journey. If the entire journey took 3 days then how long, in hours, was the spaceship not moving?",
