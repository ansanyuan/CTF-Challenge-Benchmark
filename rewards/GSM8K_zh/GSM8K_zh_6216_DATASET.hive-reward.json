  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Hattie and her friend Lorelei are doing a jumping contest using a jumping rope. Hattie does 180 jumps in the first round, while Lorelei jumps 3/4 as many times as Hattie jumped. In the second round, Lorelei does 50 more jumps than Hattie. If Hattie managed to jump 2/3 times the number of jumps she did in the first round, calculate the total number of jumps the two did in the two rounds.",
