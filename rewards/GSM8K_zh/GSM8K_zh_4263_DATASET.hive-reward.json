The next day, they traveled at 6 miles per hour for 6 hours, and then at half that speed for another three hours, before stopping to rest for the night.  On the third and final day, they traveled for 5 hours at 7 miles per hour.  In total, how far did they travel, in miles, during their horseback riding trip?",
