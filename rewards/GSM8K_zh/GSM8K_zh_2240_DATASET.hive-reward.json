Frank picked three times the number that Betty and Bill picked combined. Frank then planted 2 seeds from each of his oranges into the ground and waited 20 years for each seed to turn into a beautiful orange tree. If each orange tree contains 5 oranges for Frank's son Philip to pick, how many oranges are there for Philip to pick in total?",
