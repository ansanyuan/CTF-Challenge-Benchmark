On top of that, they need $3000 for their miscellaneous collective expenses. On the first day of their fundraiser, they receive $600. On the second day, they receive $900, and on the third day, they receive $400. For the next 4 days, they receive only half of what they raised on the first 3 days. How much more money does each person need to raise for them to reach their goal?",
