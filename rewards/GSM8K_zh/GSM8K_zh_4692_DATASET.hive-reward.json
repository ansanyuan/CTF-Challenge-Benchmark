The time it took him to fix the broken kitchen counter was three times longer than the time he took painting the house. He took 8 hours painting the house and then helped mow Miss Stevie's lawn, taking 6 hours. If he charged Miss Stevie $15 per hour of work, calculate the amount of money that Miss Stevie paid him.",
