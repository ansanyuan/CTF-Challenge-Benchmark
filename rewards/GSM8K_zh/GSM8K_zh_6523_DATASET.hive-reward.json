His second throw skips two more times across the water than his first. His third throw skips twice as many times as his second. His fourth throw skips 3 fewer times than his third throw. His fifth throw skips one more time than the fourth throw. If his fifth throw skipped 8 times across the water, how many skips did he make in total between all of his throws?",
