  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Bill decides to bring donuts to work for a meeting that day.  He buys a box of donuts that has 50 in total in them.  He eats 2 on the ride in because he's hungry.  When he gets to the office, the secretary takes another 4 out of the box when he's not looking.  Lastly, right before the meeting Bill sets the box down on his desk and leaves the office to take a phone call.  While Bill's away, his coworkers steal half the remaining donuts.  Bill comes back and brings the box into his meeting.  How many donuts are left in the box?",
