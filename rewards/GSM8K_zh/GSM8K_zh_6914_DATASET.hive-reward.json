She agrees to give Kim 9 gumballs for each pair of earrings. On the first day, Kim brings her 3 pairs of earrings. On the second she brings her twice as many. On the third day, she brings 1 less than she brought on the second day. If Kim eats 3 gumballs a day, how many days will the gumballs last?",
