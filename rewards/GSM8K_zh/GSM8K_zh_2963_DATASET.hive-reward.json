He gets reimbursed for any gas he puts in the limo, his hourly wage is $15, and he gets paid an additional $5 for every ride he gives. A positive review from a rider in his limo also gets him a $20 bonus. Today, he gave rides to three groups, drove for eight hours, and had to put 17 gallons of gas at $3 per gallon in the limo to refill the tank. He got two good reviews. How many dollars is he owed for his work today?",
