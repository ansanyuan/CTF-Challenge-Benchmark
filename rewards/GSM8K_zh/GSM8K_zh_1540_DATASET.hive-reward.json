  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Chris is trying to sell his car for $5200 and has gotten two price offers. One buyer offered to pay the full price if Chris would pay for the car maintenance inspection, which cost a tenth of Chris’s asking price. The other buyer agreed to pay the price if Chris replaced the headlights for $80 and the tires for three times as much. What is the difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers?",
