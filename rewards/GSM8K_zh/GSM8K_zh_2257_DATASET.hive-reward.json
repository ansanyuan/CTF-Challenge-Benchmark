The wait for the roller coaster is 30 minutes, the wait for the tilt-a-whirl is 60 minutes, and the wait for the giant slide is 15 minutes. If Carson rides the roller coaster 4 times and the tilt-a-whirl once, how many times can he ride the giant slide? (Wait times include the time actually spent on the ride.)",
