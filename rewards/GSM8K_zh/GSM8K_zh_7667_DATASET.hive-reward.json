On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?",
