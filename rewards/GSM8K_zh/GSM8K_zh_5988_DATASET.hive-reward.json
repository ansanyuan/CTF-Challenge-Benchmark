  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Marla is thinking about getting a canvas tote bag to avoid using plastic bags at the grocery store. If making the canvas bag released 600 pounds of carbon dioxide, each plastic bag released 4 ounces of carbon dioxide, and Marla uses eight bags per shopping trips, how many shopping trips will she have to make before the canvas bag is the lower-carbon solution? (There are 16 ounces in a pound.)",
