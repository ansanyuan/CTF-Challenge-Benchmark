  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Prudence was starting a cupcake business.  She figured that each cupcake cost $0.75 to make.  The first 2 dozen that she made burnt and she had to throw them out.  The next 2 came out perfectly and she ended up eating 5 cupcakes right away.  Later that day she made 2 more dozen cupcakes and decided to eat 4 more. If she sells the remaining cupcakes at $2.00 each, how much is her net profit?",
