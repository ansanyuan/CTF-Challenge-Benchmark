  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Stephanie is planning dinners to cook for the week and needs to figure out how much of each ingredient she should buy at the grocery store. She is making three recipes that call for lower sodium soy sauce as a main ingredient. One bottle of lower sodium soy sauce holds 16 ounces. There are 8 ounces in 1 cup. The first recipe Stephanie is going to cook calls for 2 cups of lower sodium soy sauce. The second recipe calls for 1 cup. The third recipe calls for 3 cups. If Stephanie can only buy 1 whole bottle of soy sauce no matter how much she needs exactly, how many bottles of lower sodium soy sauce should Stephanie buy to allow for all three recipes?",
