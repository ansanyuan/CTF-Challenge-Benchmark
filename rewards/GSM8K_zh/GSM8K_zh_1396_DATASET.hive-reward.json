A friend of Mike's, Steve, saw this and also decided to buy a DVD of the movie, but it was already sold out. He needed to order it online, which cost him twice as much. And in addition, he needed to pay the shipping costs which were 80% of the price of the film he ordered. How much did Steve pay to get the DVD in total?",
