  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：A father is building a playset for his son and needs to purchase lumber, nails, and fabric.  When he started planning the project, the necessary lumber cost $450, the nails cost $30, and the fabric cost $80.  However, recent economic inflation has caused the price of lumber to increase by 20%, the price of nails to increase by 10%, and the price of fabric to increase by 5%.  In dollars, how much more money will it cost to complete the project now (after inflation) than it would have when the father began planning?",
