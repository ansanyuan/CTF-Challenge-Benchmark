He is currently working for three clients, with the first client paying him half the amount of money he currently has on his dashboard once the job is done. The second client will pay him 2/5 times more money than the first client once Baylor finishes his work. The third client will pay him twice the amount of money the first and second clients pay him together once he finishes the job. How much money will Baylor have in his dashboard after all the clients pay him for his work?",
