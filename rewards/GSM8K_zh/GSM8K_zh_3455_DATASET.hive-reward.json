  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：A local college is offering German lessons and currently has 8 students enrolled. Through advertising, 8 more became interested but a fourth of these dropped out within a day. 2 more got frustrated and left. The class then rallied to show how simple the course actually is and increased enrollment by 5 times the amount of students already enrolled in the class, but 2 had to drop it because of scheduling conflicts. After one last rally, 6 more people enrolled. As the days passed, half of the class eventually dropped, and half of the remaining students graduated. How many are still enrolled?",
