Both pies will need $2 for flour, $1 for sugar and $1.5 for eggs and butter to make the crust. The blueberry pie needs 3 pounds of blueberries. The blueberries come in 8 oz containers for $2.25. For the cherry pie, she needs 4 pounds and they come in a four-pound bag for $14. What is the total price to make the cheapest pie?",
