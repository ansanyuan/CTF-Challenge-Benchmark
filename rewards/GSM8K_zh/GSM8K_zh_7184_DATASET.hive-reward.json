  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：A coal-powered train is traveling towards a faraway city when the conductor realizes that he forgot to restock the train's coal supply at the last station.  The train is traveling on a one-way track, so the conductor has no other option but to continue moving forward towards the city.  The train can travel 5 miles for every 2 pounds of coal that it consumes.  If the train has 160 pounds of coal remaining, how far can the train travel before it runs out of fuel?",
