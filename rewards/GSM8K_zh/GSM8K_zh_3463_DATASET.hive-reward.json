  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：After complaints from the residents of Tatoosh about the number of cats on the island, the wildlife service carried out a relocation mission that saw the number of cats on the island drastically reduced. On the first relocation mission, 600 cats were relocated from the island to a neighboring island. On the second mission, half of the remaining cats were relocated to a rescue center inland. If the number of cats originally on the island was 1800, how many cats remained on the island after the rescue mission?",
