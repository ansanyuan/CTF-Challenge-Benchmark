  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：James was doing some shopping in his favorite shop and he saw an offer on shoes that give him a second pair of shoes for half off the original price. He took the offer and took the first pair of shoes for $40 and the second one for $60. At the cashier, the lady told him that the offer applies strictly to the cheaper pair of shoes, and also that he was selected for an extra discount of a fourth off the total amount. How much money did James end up paying for both pairs of shoes?",
