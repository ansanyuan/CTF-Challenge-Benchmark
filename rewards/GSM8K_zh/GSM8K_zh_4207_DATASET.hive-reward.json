  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：A family just bought a newborn puppy that must eat a special type of dog food until it is 1 year old.  The puppy needs to eat 2 ounces of this special dog food per day during the first 60 days of its life.  After that, it needs to eat 4 ounces per day of the special food until it is old enough to eat regular dog food.  If the special dog food is only sold in 5-pound bags, and there are 16 ounces in a pound, how many bags will the family need to buy to feed the puppy until it is old enough to eat regular dog food?",
