  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Each of the three Morales sisters owns an orange grove that has 110 trees. Each orange tree produces medium-sized oranges. At harvest time, Gabriela's grove produced 600 oranges per tree, while Alba harvested 400 per tree. Each of Maricela's trees produced 500 oranges. With such a huge harvest, the sisters are thinking of making orange juice for sale. If it takes three medium-sized oranges to make 1 cup of juice, and then they sell each cup for $4, how much money will they make?",
