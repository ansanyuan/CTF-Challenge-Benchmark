  "topic": "回答下面的数学问题：Pirate Rick sailed his ship to a tropical island in search of a site to bury his treasure.  After finding the perfect site, it took him 4 hours to dig up 8 feet of sand under which to bury the treasure.  Once the treasure was buried, he left the island.  Then, a tropical storm came and washed away half of the sand from on top of the treasure.  Next, a giant tsunami wave poured over the island, adding 2 feet of new sand back onto the site of his treasure. When Pirate Rick returned, how long did it take for him to dig up his treasure?",
