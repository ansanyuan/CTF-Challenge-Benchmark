At the same time, a circular storm, whose radius is $51$ miles, moves southeast at $\\frac 12\\sqrt{2}$ miles per minute. At time $t=0$ , the center of the storm is $110$ miles due north of the car. At time $t=t_1$ minutes, the car enters the storm circle, and at time $t=t_2$ minutes, the car leaves the storm circle. Find $\\frac 12(t_1+t_2)$ .",
