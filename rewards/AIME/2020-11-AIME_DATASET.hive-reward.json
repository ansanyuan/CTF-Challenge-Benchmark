David computes each of the three sums $P + Q$ , $P + R$ , and $Q + R$ and is surprised to find that each pair of these sums has a common root, and these three common roots are distinct. If $Q(0) = 2$ , then $R(0) = \\frac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$ .",
