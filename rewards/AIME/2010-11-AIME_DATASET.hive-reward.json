When $\\mathcal{R}$ is revolved around the line whose equation is $3y - x = 15$ , the volume of the resulting solid is $\\frac {m\\pi}{n\\sqrt {p}}$ , where $m$ , $n$ , and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n + p$ .",
