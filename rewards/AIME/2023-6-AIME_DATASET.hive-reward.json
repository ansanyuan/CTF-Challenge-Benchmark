Two points $A$ and $B$ are chosen independently and uniformly at random from inside the region. The probability that the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ also lies inside this L-shaped region can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$ [asy] unitsize(2cm); draw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,1)--(1,1)--(1,2)--(0,2)--cycle); draw((0,1)--(1,1)--(1,0),dashed); [/asy]",
