They arrive at the cafeteria independently, at random times between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., and stay for exactly $m$ minutes.  The probability that either one arrives while the other is in the cafeteria is $40 \\%,$ and $m = a - b\\sqrt {c},$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers , and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime .  Find $a + b + c.$",
