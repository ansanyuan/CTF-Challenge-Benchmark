Circle $Q$ is externally tangent to circle $P$ and is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ . No point of circle $Q$ lies outside of $\\bigtriangleup\\overline{ABC}$ . The radius of circle $Q$ can be expressed in the form $m - n\\sqrt{k}$ ,where $m$ , $n$ , and $k$ are positive integers and $k$ is the product of distinct primes. Find $m +nk$ .",
