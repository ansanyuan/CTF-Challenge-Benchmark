Diagonals $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{BD}$ intersect at $P^{}_{}$ .  If triangle $ABP^{}_{}$ is cut out and removed, edges $\\overline{AP}$ and $\\overline{BP}$ are joined, and the figure is then creased along segments $\\overline{CP}$ and $\\overline{DP}$ , we obtain a triangular pyramid, all four of whose faces are isosceles triangles.  Find the volume of this pyramid. AIME 1990 Problem 14.png",
