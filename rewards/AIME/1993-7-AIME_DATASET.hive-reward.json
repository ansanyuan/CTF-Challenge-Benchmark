Three other numbers, $b_1, b_2, b_3$ , are then drawn randomly and without replacement from the remaining set of $997$ numbers. Let $p$ be the probability that, after suitable rotation, a brick of dimensions $a_1 \\times a_2 \\times a_3$ can be enclosed in a box of dimension $b_1 \\times b_2 \\times b_3$ , with the sides of the brick parallel to the sides of the box. If $p$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?",
