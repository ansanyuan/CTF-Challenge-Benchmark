The line parallel to $AB$ that passes through $P$ intersects $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ for the second time at points $X$ and $Y,$ respectively. Suppose $PX=10,$ $PY=14,$ and $PQ=5.$ Then the area of trapezoid $XABY$ is $m\\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n.$",
