Vertex $A$ of the cube is set on a horizontal plane $\\mathcal{P}$ so that the plane of the rectangle $ABDC$ is perpendicular to $\\mathcal{P},$ vertex $B$ is $2$ meters above $\\mathcal{P},$ vertex $C$ is $8$ meters above $\\mathcal{P},$ and vertex $D$ is $10$ meters above $\\mathcal{P}.$ The cube contains water whose surface is parallel to $\\mathcal{P}$ at a height of $7$ meters above $\\mathcal{P}.$ The volume of water is $\\frac{m}{n}$ cubic meters, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
